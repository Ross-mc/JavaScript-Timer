# Javascript Timer

Following on from my Javascript Calculator, I wanted to build another Javascript program but without following any tutorials and simply using my own logic and code. This was a challenging as at the time I had only been coding for about 1 month so I was very excited when the timer began to function as expected. This timer was coded in HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript, as I had not yet learnt any more advanced libraries (such as jQuery and Bootstrap).

The Timer is live [here](https://www.rossmcintyre.tech/Javascript%20Timer/javascript-timer.html).
